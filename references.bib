	abstract = {Four approaches to playing MUDs are identified and described. These approaches may arise from the inter-relationship of two dimensions of playing style: action versus interaction, and world-oriented versus player-oriented. An account of the dynamics of player populations is given in terms of these dimensions, with particular attention to how to promote balance or equilibrium. This analysis also offers an explanation for the labelling of MUDs as being either "social" or "gamelike".},

	abstract = {This paper briefly presents a player satisfaction model called BrainHex, which was based on insights from neurobiological findings as well as the results from earlier demographic game design models (DGD1 and DGD2). The model presents seven different archetypes of players: Seeker, Survivor, Daredevil, Mastermind, Conqueror, Socialiser, and Achiever. We explain how each of these player archetypes relates to older player typologies (such as Myers-Briggs), and how each archetype characterizes a specific playing style. We conducted a survey among more than 50,000 players using the BrainHex model as a personality type motivator to gather and compare demographic data to the different BrainHex archetypes. We discuss some results from this survey with a focus on psychometric orientation of respondents, to establish relationships between personality types and BrainHex archetypes.},

	abstract = {Understanding the nature and influence of social relationships is of increasing interest to behavioral economists, and behavioral scientists more generally. In turn, this creates a need for tractable, and reliable, tools for measuring fundamental aspects of social relationships. We provide a comprehensive evaluation of the 'Inclusion of the Other in the Self' (IOS) Scale, a handy pictorial tool for measuring the subjectively perceived closeness of a relationship. The tool is highly portable, very easy for subjects to understand and takes less than 1 minute to administer. Across our three online studies with a diverse adult population (n = 772) we show that six different scales designed to measure relationship closeness are all highly significantly positively correlated with the IOS Scale. We then conduct a Principal Component Analysis to construct an Index of Relationship Closeness and find that it correlates very strongly (ρ = 85) with the IOS Scale. We conclude that the IOS Scale is a psychologically meaningful and highly reliable measure of the subjective closeness of relationships.},

	abstract = {Digital gaming presents an engaging, widely varied, and increasingly popular pastime. Yet in recent theorising about digital game experience, the social richness of playing is often marginalised or neglected all together. We argue that, although not previously recognized or defined as such, digital gaming technology can usefully be regarded as social presence technology, as it provides a setting for interacting with others at a distance and augments communication in co-located settings. In the service of future investigations of game experience, and gaming as a social experience in particular, we developed a self-report measure, the Social Presence in Gaming Questionnaire (SPGQ), based on focus group interviews with both casual and avid gamers and a social presence scale developed for other social presence devices – the Networked Minds Measure of Social Presence [40]. This paper describes the factor structure of this new measure and explores basic sensitivity and validity.},

A large number of player experience questionnaires are available, but in most cases empirical validation of the scales is limited or absent. Two of the most commonly used scales are the Player Experience of Need Satisfaction (PENS) and the Game Experience Questionnaire (GEQ). Both scales were developed using a rational-theoretical approach, but neither scale has had formal factor-analytic studies published, limiting our capacity to judge the empirical validity of the scales. We present detailed exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses of both scales based on responses from a sample (n = 571) of videogame players. The GEQ is partially supported (using a revised factor structure); the PENS is largely supported (with a more minor revision of the factor structure). We provide suggestions for the most effective use of both scales in future research.},

Understanding users’ motivation to engage and enjoy immersive VR exercise platforms is thus important to designers. We designed a VR exercise platform and conducted an experiment with two conditions, one with a static User Interface (UI) and the other with an Open World environment. Across participants there was significantly (p= .03*) greater enjoyment reported in an Open World compared to static UI. Enjoyment in both static UI and Open World conditions was positively correlated with user’s psychological needs and experience; autonomy and immersion. Participants’ future play intention was also predicted by autonomy and immersion, but only within the open world condition. Our findings also suggest players can be classified into entertainment-focused and exercise-focused with different expectations and therefore different engagement behaviours with each VR exercise environment. The study highlights the value of informing VR design with measures of psychological need satisfaction.},

To fill this gap, the Game Engagement Questionnaire (GEQ) was developed using both classical and Rasch analyses. In Study 1 Rasch analyses provide support for the reliability and functionality of the GEQ scores. Rasch analyses also demonstrate that the GEQ has adequate separation, fit, rating scale functioning, and dimensionality, suggesting that one’s tendency to become engaged in video game-playing is a quantifiable construct. In Study 2, behavioral and questionnaire data supported the reliability and validity of the GEQ for predicting engagement in violent video games. The GEQ provides a psychometrically strong measure of levels of engagement specifically elicited while playing video games, and thus shows promise for future research examining risk and protective factors for negative game impact.},

The first experiment investigated participants’ abilities to switch from an immersive to a non-immersive task. The second experiment investigated whether there were changes in participants’ eye movements during an immersive task. The third experiment investigated the effect of an externally imposed pace of interaction on immersion and affective measures (state anxiety, positive affect, negative affect). Overall the findings suggest that immersion can be measured subjectively (through questionnaires) as well as objectively (task completion time, eye movements). Furthermore, immersion is not only viewed as a positive experience: negative emotions and uneasiness (i.e. anxiety) also run high.},

We present an exploratory study where ten caregiving dyads played cooperative motion-based video games, and follow up with two case studies to analyze how video game play affects older adults and family caregivers. Our results show that playing games generally represents an enjoyable activity for older adults and caregivers that can be integrated into the caregiving context. Based on our findings, we highlight design opportunities, and outline core challenges that need to be addressed to design accessible games that provide positive shared experiences for a wide range of caregiving dyads.},

Belongingness appears to have multiple and strong effects on emotional patterns and on cognitive processes. Lack of attachments is linked to a variety of ill effects on health, adjustment, and well-being. Other evidence, such as that concerning satiation, substitution, and behavioral consequences, is likewise consistent with the hypothesized motivation. Several seeming counterexamples turned out not to disconfirm the hypothesis.

Eighty participants were assigned to play a violent video game cooperatively or competitively with a confederate posing as an outgroup or ingroup member. The main findings corroborate previous research on the beneficial effects of cooperative game play and suggest playing cooperatively can increase helping behavior. Furthermore, cooperation with an outgroup member can actually reduce aggression. Implications of findings for future research are discussed.},

Unfortunately, very little research investigated cooperative patterns or methods to evaluate them. In this paper, we present a set of cooperative patterns identified based on analysis of fourteen cooperative games. Additionally, we propose Cooperative Performance Metrics (CPM). To evaluate the use of these CPMs, we ran a study with a total of 60 participants, grouped in 2-3 participants per session. Participants were asked to play four cooperative games (Rock Band 2, Lego Star Wars, Kameo, and Little Big Planet). Videos of the play sessions were annotated using the CPMs, which were then mapped to cooperative patterns that caused them. Results, validated through inter-rater agreement, identify several effective cooperative patterns and lessons for future cooperative game designs.},

Studies on digital games have shown that social characteristics of play settings have a strong impact on players' in-game experience. As little attention has been given to casual games in literature, in this paper we discuss the important role of social factors in understanding and measuring player experience in casual digital games.},

Although widely used in co-located or asynchronous settings, cooperative gameplay elements are not popular in networked synchronous casual games. In our study, we have analyzed different types of cooperation between players in casual games. Each of these is based on a certain cooperative game design pattern, and can be classified as either closely- or loosely-coupled. Six game patterns have been selected and an equal number of games developed, each targeting one pattern. By means of a user experiment we have investigated which cooperation types fit most of the criteria that define casual games. More specifically, we have focused on the applicability of close coupling between players. Based on the games used in the experiment, most patterns with closely-coupled interaction have shown an overall higher user evaluation than loosely-coupled, satisfying criteria of casual games. These results indicate that introducing close coupling in the casual games under consideration is a potential way to increase the player experience.},

Players could use voice, textual chat, pre-determined commands or a combination of these methods in order to command a team, follow an appointed leader or simply to socialise with friends. There is an abundance of reasons why a person will choose to utilise the conversational frameworks available, however, when considering a game where players must work together in order to reach a common goal, it is up for interpretation to determine which method works most efficiently. The aim of this work is to address this need through a game that utilises these three methods of communication in order to determine their efficiency. A combination of qualitative and quantitative methods was employed to formulate a well-rounded conclusion. Results indicated that a combination of voice and predetermined commands is the most efficient method of in-game communication in online, task-oriented games.},

	abstract = {Scalability, fast response time, and low cost are of utmost importance in designing a successful massively multiplayer online game. The underlying architecture plays an important role in meeting these conditions. Peer-to-peer architectures, due to their distributed and collaborative nature, have low infrastructure costs and can achieve high scalability. They can also achieve fast response times by creating direct connections between players. However, these architectures face many challenges. Distributing a game among peers makes maintaining control over the game more complex. Peer-to-peer architectures also tend to be vulnerable to churn and cheating. Moreover, different genres of games have different requirements that should be met by the underlying architecture, rendering the task of designing a general-purpose architecture harder. Many peer-to-peer gaming solutions have been proposed that utilize a range of techniques while using somewhat different and confusing terminologies. This article presents a comprehensive overview of current peer-to-peer solutions for massively multiplayer games using a uniform terminology.},

Such systems can potentially accommodate large groups of users participating in MR. However, we lack an understanding of how group sizes and interaction methods affect the user experience. In this paper, we aim to advance our understanding of handheld-based MR in the context of multiplayer, co-located games. We conducted a study (N = 38) to understand how user experiences vary by group size (2, 4, and 8) and interaction method (proximity-based or pointing-based). For our experiment, we implemented a multiuser experience for up to ten users. We found that proximity-based interaction that encouraged dynamic movement positively affected social presence and physical/temporal workload. In bigger group settings, participants felt less challenged and less positive. Individuals had varying preferences for group size and interaction type. The findings of the study will advance our understanding of the design space for handheld-based MR in terms of group sizes and interaction schemes. To make our contributions explicit, we conclude our paper with design implications that can inform user experience design in handheld-based mixed reality contexts.},

We evaluate its impact on task performance, immersion, and collaborative interaction. Our solution targets scenarios like live presentations or multi-user collaborative systems, where it is not convenient to develop a VR multiplayer experience and supply each user (and spectator) with an HMD. The spectator views the virtual world on a large-scale tiled video wall and is given the ability to control the orientation of their own virtual camera. This allows spectators to stay focused on the immersed user's point of view or freely look around the environment. To improve collaboration between users, we implemented a pointing system where a spectator can point at objects on the screen, which maps an indicator directly onto the objects in the virtual world. We conducted a user study to investigate the influence of rotational camera decoupling and pointing gestures in the context of HMD-immersed and non-immersed users utilizing a large-scale display. Our results indicate that camera decoupling and pointing positively impacts collaboration. A decoupled view is preferable in situations where both users need to indicate objects of interest in the scene, such as presentations and joint-task scenarios, as it requires a shared reference space. A coupled view, on the other hand, is preferable in synchronous interactions such as remote-assistant scenarios.},

Existing efforts have focused mainly on the symmetric use of technology, which excludes a rising form of interaction known as asymmetric VR, in which co-located participants use different interfaces to interact with a shared environment. There must be a clear path to creating asymmetric VR systems that are rooted in previous work from several fields, as these systems have use cases in education, hybrid reality teams (using VR and other technologies to interact online and face to face), accessibility, as well as entertainment. Currently, there is no systematic way to characterize 1) how a system may be asymmetric, 2) how the different mediation technology and affordances within asymmetric VR support (or do not support) users' goals, and 3) the relationships and collaborative capabilities between users of these different technologies. In this paper, the authors use a scoping review to explore relevant conceptual frameworks for asymmetric interaction, mediation technology, and computer supported cooperative work to clarify the dimensions of asymmetry and synthesize the literature into a Composite framework for Asymmetric VR (CAVR). The paper concludes with suggestions of ways to test and expand the framework in order to guide future research as it identifies the most-beneficial interaction paradigms for co-located asymmetric VR.},

However, there are many instances where people might want to play together, but would normally choose vastly different games for themselves, due to these various asymmetries in play experiences, such as grandparents and grandchildren, highly skilled players and novices, or even simply two players that enjoy different games. In this work, we aim to improve the design of asymmetric games-games that are designed to embrace and leverage differences between players to improve multiplayer engagement. This paper builds upon prior work to describe the elements of asymmetry that can be used to design such games, and uses these elements in the design of an asymmetric game, Beam Me 'Round Scotty'! We present the results of a thematic analysis of a player experience study, discuss these findings, and propose an initial conceptual framework for discussion of design elements relevant to asymmetric games.},

Multiplayer asymmetric games in particular have been shown to increase teamwork and a collaborative mindset even after a play session has ended. Asymmetric design is commonplace in both digital and analog games but has yet to see widespread adoption in the emerging Virtual Reality (VR) gaming space. BirdQuestVR seeks to leverage the affordances of current consumer-grade VR headsets to build asymmetric gameplay around communication, embodied performance, and physical humour.},

For example, sighted players have a multitude of highly visual games at their disposal, while blind players may choose from a variety of audio games. Attempts at improving cross-ability access to any of those are often limited in the experience they provide, or disregard multiplayer experiences. We explore ability-based asymmetric roles as a design approach to create engaging and challenging mixed-ability play. Our team designed and developed two collaborative testbed games exploring asymmetric interdependent roles. In a remote study with 13 mixed-visual-ability pairs we assessed how roles affected perceptions of engagement, competence, and autonomy, using a mixed-methods approach. The games provided an engaging and challenging experience, in which differences in visual ability were not limiting. Our results underline how experiences unequal by design can give rise to an equitable joint experience.},

	abstract = {Envisioning a future with prevalent use of Mixed Reality (MR) Head-mounted Displays (HMD), introducing MR headsets into public and social spaces creates complex social challenges. The first challenge is the inherent power imbalance between collocated HMD wearers and non-wearers, where non-wearers cannot see what HMD wearers see. The second challenge is the inherent asymmetry of MR experiences between collocated HMD wearers, where each HMD wearer can only see their MR digital objects privately, perceiving their own version of reality. How can we leverage the imbalances and asymmetry of the MR medium into game elements for a unique gaming experience? This demonstration introduces "MOFA The Ghost", an asymmetrical inter-bodily mixed reality social exertion game inspired by the cinematic classic, Ghostbusters. Based on spontaneous collocated mixed reality technology, the design of "MOFA The Ghost" engages across three dimensions of asymmetry: device asymmetry, by integrating the game interaction utilizing device imbalance power dynamics, MR HMDs and Handheld Augmented Reality (HAR); gameplay asymmetry, through unique roles like the Ghost Controller, Detector, and Ghostbuster, each with specific objectives and limitations; and information asymmetry, fostering a specific limited visual perception with an augmented audiovisual layer for specific roles. Thanks to asymmetry of MR medium, this game encourages all collocated players to be socially competitive and cooperative at the same time. This game illuminates the potential for new design paradigms within spontaneous collocated mixed reality gaming.},

Specifically, the roles include: a HAR player as a third-person passive participant (termed spectator), a third-person active participant (termed puppeteer), a first-person participant, and a first-person partial-information participant; and a StAR player as a first-person participant and a first-person partial-information participant.

While VR environments can deeply immerse the person wearing the headset, spectators are often not actively involved or are not even considered in the design phase. This is an issue for learning environments, as learning often takes place in pairs or groups. We propose a novel system that enables more than one person to join the VR world in a co-located space to overcome this problem. In addition to the classic VR headset, the asymmetric VR system features a position-tracked tablet. To evaluate this asymmetric VR concept, we conducted a study with 14 students to explore the user experience and motivation, the social presence, and possible further fields of application. The results indicate that users in both perspectives feel that they can control the virtual world.},

With the freedom and flexibility to choose the most suitable device, we allow for inclusive environments where even spectators can be involved. However, existing research has mostly been conducted in controlled laboratory settings, which limits the applicability of the findings to naturalistic scenarios. We conducted a mixed methods study with social XR experts to explore situated and asymmetrical modalities in the context of XR gaming for enabling social interactions in naturalistic social settings, focusing on two games. We considered variations in available devices, spatial constraints, and users’ motivations and expertise. Our research suggests that asymmetrical interfaces may reduce barriers to entry for XR, support social connection, and promote cross-platform communication and collaboration. Together, our findings provoke critical discussions for future work on the effective deployment of asymmetrical interfaces in naturalistic scenarios and address potential technical, spatial, and social challenges.},

But maintaining a strong level of interaction between different player roles poses a challenge, which is exacerbated in competitive games. This paper seeks to find solutions to this problem in the context of RaceTrap, a competitive asymmetric racing game. RaceTrap combines card-playing and racing elements, where one player uses cards to create obstacles and the other tries to avoid these obstacles while driving in Virtual Reality. We address the central challenge of coupling, or maintaining a high level of awareness and interaction between the roles. The paper reviews existing approaches to coupling in asymmetric cooperative games, and highlights the needs for an improved coupling in competitive asymmetric games. We present features implemented in RaceTrap to improve coupling. These solutions highlight the importance of coupling in the emerging field of asymmetric games.},

This paper presents a taxonomy for player actions with latency in network games, where player actions are defined by their precision, deadline \&amp; impact. The effects of latency along each dimension of the taxonomy are analyzed through extensive experiments with a custom 2d game. Efficacy of the taxonomy in game development is illustrated by experiments that show improved player performance when prioritizing player actions based on their expected impact derived from the taxonomy dimensions.},

ITSB leverages the synchronization of both players' input to steer a canoe down a river and avoid obstacles. We created two versions: embodied controls, which use players' physiological signals (breath rate, facial expressions), and standard keyboard controls. Results from a study with 35 dyads indicate that ITSB fostered affiliation, and while embodied controls were less intuitive, people enjoyed them more. Further, photos of the dyads were rated as happier and closer in the embodied condition, indicating the potential of embodied controls to foster social closeness in synchronized play over a distance.},

We summarize literature on game design for social closeness into a framework with two collaborative mechanics: cooperation and interdependence. We then created four versions of an online game to independently test the effects of these game mechanics on relationship formation between paired online strangers, showing that cooperation and interdependence are two distinct factors that both can be used to improve play experience and increase social bonds. Additionally, we unpack the effect of interdependence, showing that the improved social closeness can be explained by the increase in conversational turns.},

Subsequently, we analyse and discuss this data to identify generalisability in these games. In our discussion we identify how these findings address game design problems of designing collaborative games. Furthermore, we contribute to theory of designing for social play from the perspectives of co-located mobile contexts in game design by identifying how mobility: (1) affords co-locating with other players in public spaces, (2) supports physical interactions using spatial context and players bodies, extending games beyond their formal system, (3) supports asymmetric design with information and interaction. Finally we contribute the concept of a pocket magic circle, a particular magic circle, to support a focus on game design leveraging these intersecting properties.},

The underlying idea is always the same: players have to solve many diverse puzzles to (virtually) escape from a locked room. Within the last decade, we witnessed a rapidly increasing popularity of such games, which also amplified the amount of related research. However, the respective academic landscape is mostly fragmented in its current state, lacking a common model and vocabulary that would withstand these games' variety. This manuscript aims to establish such a foundation for the analysis and construction of escape rooms. In a first step, we derive a high-level design framework from prior literature. Then, as our main contribution, we establish an atomic puzzle taxonomy that closes the gap between the analog and digital domains. The taxonomy is developed in multiple steps: we compose a basic structure based on previous literature and systematically refine it by analyzing 39 analog and digital escape room games, including recent virtual reality representatives. The final taxonomy consists of mental, physical, and emotional challenges, thereby providing a robust and approachable basis for future works across all application domains that deal with escape rooms or puzzles in general.},

We contribute our classification and analysis of 622 elicited gestures (showing more collaborative gestures in the mid-air modality), resulting in a consensus gesture set, and agreement rates showing higher consensus for touch gestures. Furthermore, we identified interaction patterns – such as benefits of situational awareness, social etiquette, gestures fostering interaction between players, and roles of gestures providing fun, excitement, and suspense to the game – which can inform future games and gesture design.},

	abstract = {Multiplayer virtual reality (VR) games introduce the problem of variations in the physical size and shape of each user's space for mapping into a shared virtual space. We propose an asymmetric approach to solve the spatial variation problem, by allowing people to choose roles based on the size of their space. We demonstrate this concept through the implementation of a virtual snowball fight where players can choose from multiple roles, namely the shooter, the target, or an onlooker depending on whether the game is played remotely or together in one large space. In the co-located version, the target stands behind an actuated cardboard fort that responds to events in VR, providing non-VR spectators a way to participate in the experience. During preliminary deployment, users showed extremely positive reactions and the spectators were thrilled.},

Asymmetric cooperative games have shown promise in this regard but the design and dynamics of this unique style of play is not yet well understood. To address this, we present the results of two player experience studies using our custom prototype game Beam Me 'Round, Scotty! 2: the first comparing symmetric cooperative play (e.g., where players have the same interface, goals, mechanics, etc.) to asymmetric cooperative play (e.g., where players have differing roles, abilities, interfaces, etc.) and the second comparing the effect of increasing degrees of interdependence between play partners. Our results not only indicate that asymmetric cooperative games may enhance players' perceptions of connectedness, social engagement, immersion, and comfort with a game's controls, but also demonstrate how to further improve these outcomes via deliberate mechanical design changes, such as changes in cooperative action timing and direction of dependence.},

	abstract = {We developed a method to synthesize game levels that accounts for the degree of collaboration required by two players to finish a given game level. We first asked a game level designer to create playable game level chunks. Then, two artificial intelligence (AI) virtual agents driven by behavior trees played each game level chunk. We recorded the degree of collaboration required to accomplish each game level chunk by the AI virtual agents and used it to characterize each game level chunk. To synthesize a game level, we assigned to the total cost function cost terms that encode both the degree of collaboration and game level design decisions. Then, we used a Markov-chain Monte Carlo optimization method, called simulated annealing, to solve the total cost function and proposed a design for a game level. We synthesized three game levels (low, medium, and high degrees of collaboration game levels) to evaluate our implementation. We then recruited groups of participants to play the game levels to explore whether they would experience a certain degree of collaboration and validate whether the AI virtual agents provided sufficient data that described the collaborative behavior of players in each game level chunk. By collecting both in-game objective measurements and self-reported subjective ratings, we found that the three game levels indeed impacted the collaboration gameplay behavior of our participants. Moreover, by analyzing our collected data, we found moderate and strong correlations between the participants and the AI virtual agents. These results show that game developers can consider AI virtual agents as an alternative method for evaluating the degree of collaboration required to finish a game level.},

	abstract = {Collaborative games, played across multiple co-located mobile devices are gaining popularity because of their location flexibility, low hardware requirements, players’ close proximity, and their promise of generating excitement and collaborative social experience. Even though the integration of spatial device rearrangement (i.e., physically picking up a device and positioning it in another location) in cross-device applications in other domains has demonstrated higher potential for collaboration, this form of interaction remains relatively unexplored in ad hoc cross-device gaming applications. That is because these interactions typically require additional hardware support, which can hinder the ad hoc nature of the cross-device social games. In this paper, we present the iterative user-centred design process of creating an ad hoc co-located cross-device maze exploration game named Snap-To-Eat that supports both on-screen cross-device interactions (e.g., moving elements across devices) and spatial device rearrangement interactions without requiring any additional hardware. We refined the game design by conducting two rounds of workshops, the first with a low-fidelity paper prototype and the second with a high-fidelity digital prototype, with 36 undergraduate and graduate students in total. Findings from both workshops demonstrated that integrating spatial device rearrangement interactions in an ad hoc co-located cross-device game created opportunities for collaboration and engagement among the players, which elevated their overall social experience. These findings also suggested new design opportunities and future research directions for ad hoc collocated cross-device games, e.g., introducing new interactions, as well as exploring the game mechanics in a 3D space to elevate the gaming experience.},

Our paper tackles this issue by establishing a research model for social player interaction highlighting the impact of the game design, the player group, and the gaming setting. Based on that model, we investigated the influence of three particular game design patterns - player interdependence, time pressure, and shared control - on the interaction of players. For that purpose, we developed a co-located game to systematically test variations of those patterns. We analyzed the resulting player experience and social interaction by applying questionnaires and videotaping game play sessions. Results indicate that high player interdependence implies more communication and less frustration, whereas shared control results in less perceived competence and autonomy. Moreover, individual player characteristics also impact the social interaction.},

Following this approach, we designed a testbed game and conducted a mixed-methods remote study with six pairs of adult-child family members. Our results showcase how asymmetric, asynchronous experiences can be leveraged to create novel gaming experiences that meet the requirements of family play.

We describe how LFCG can be used as a tool for analyses and ideation, and as a shared language for describing a game’s design. LFCG is published as a web application to facilitate use and appropriation. It supports the creation, dissemination and aggregation of game reports and specifications; and enables stakeholders to extend and publish custom versions.

	abstract = {Multiplayer games with social aspects vary widely regarding client design, e.g., point of view or camera perspective. While design paradigms usually arise from gold standards that are set by previously successful games in the industry, the impact of such paradigms is under-researched for games that serve as scientific instruments, e.g., to research social behavior. Intending to investigate how such games should be designed, we built two multiplayer clients with the same game logic, one using a first-person point of view, while the other includes a top-down camera perspective. Then, we conducted an online user study in which players tested these game clients in extensive multiplayer sessions. Analyzing speech time, in-game logs, questionnaires, and qualitative feedback, we look at the perspectives’ impact on player behavior, engagement, and game experience in a scientific or "serious games" context. In addition, we have made our designed game UNISON and both clients available as open source to facilitate future empirical social science research.},

This article proposes the design of a multiplayer cyber-physical gaming environment with Augmented Reality for the execution of group activities following a circular empathy model. This model is transformed into a gamified framework of tasks and steps with main emphasis on the execution of scenarios that generate affective, cognitive, reflective and social experiences to promote empathy and prosocial behavior. Our proposal was evaluated by a group of 34 high school students and the results revealed increased empathy and prosocial behavior in the participants. The preliminary results are promising and are a motive for the future construction of gamified environments to promote empathy in terms of prosocial behavior in children and teenagers.},

Previous studies have shown that asymmetric virtual reality (VR) games —games that utilize and consider differences of various kinds— can improve users’ social and player experience. However, the impact of existing social factors on users’ experiences is still unknown in asymmetric games. In this paper, we designed and implemented an asymmetric game in which both players are in VR. In the game, players had to exchange asymmetric information to complete tasks, resulting in a strategic interdependence. We studied how familiarity (friends vs. strangers) affects social and player experience, as well as game performance. In our preliminary between-participants study (N=14), we did not find significant differences between the friend and stranger teams in social and player experience, or game performance. We discuss how asymmetries can be used to create social VR games, and how and why familiarity does (not) affect the experience of players.},

Previous work shows this enhances player experience (PX). Until now, it remains unclear whether and how an asymmetric game design with interdependences creates comparably enjoyable PX for both an HMD and a non-HMD player. In this work, we designed and implemented an asymmetric VR game (different in its user interface) with two types of interdependence: strategic (difference in game information/player capability) and biometric (difference in player’s biometric influence). Our mixed-methods user study (N=30) shows that asymmetries positively impact PX for both player roles, that interdependence strongly affects players’ perception of agency, and that biometric feedback—while subjective—is a valuable game mechanic.},

	abstract = {Mobile augmented reality (AR) has been widely used in smart and mobile device-based applications such as entertainment, games, visual experience, and information visualization. However, most of the mobile AR applications have limitations in natural user interaction and do not fully support the direct manipulation of 3D AR objects. This paper proposes a new method for naturally and directly manipulating 3D AR objects through touch and hand gesture-based interactions in handheld devices. The touch gesture is used for the AR object selection and the natural hand gesture is used for the direct and interactive manipulation of the selected objects. Thus, the hybrid interaction makes the user more accurately interact with and manipulate AR objects in the real 3D space, not in the 2D space. In particular, natural hand gestures are detected by the Leap Motion sensor attached to the front or back of mobile devices. Thus the user can easily interacts with 3D AR objects for 3D transformation to enhance usability and usefulness. In this research, comprehensive comparative analyses were performed among the proposed approach and the widely used screen touch-based approach and vision-based approach in terms of quantitative and qualitative aspects. Quantitative analysis was conducted by measuring task completion time and failure rate to perform given tasks such as 3D object matching and grasp-hang-release operation. Both tasks require simultaneous 3D translation and 3D rotation. In addition, we have compared the gesture performance depending on whether the gesture sensor is located in the front or the back of the mobile device. Furthermore, to support other complex operations, an assembly task has also been evaluated. The assembly task consists of a sequence of combining parts into a sub-assembly. Qualitative analysis was performed through enquiring questionnaire after the experiment that examines factors such as ease-of-use, ease-of-natural interaction, etc. Both analyses showed that the proposed approach can provide more natural and intuitive interaction and manipulation of mobile AR objects. Several implementation results will also be given to show the advantage and effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

The technical improvements in the hardware of smartphones, tablets, and smart-glasses provide an advantage for the wide use of mobile AR in the real world and experience these AR applications anywhere. However, the mobile nature of MAR applications can limit users’ interaction capabilities, such as input and haptic feedback. In this survey, we analyze current research issues in the area of human-computer interaction for haptic technologies in MAR scenarios. The survey first presents human sensing capabilities and their applicability in AR applications. We classify haptic devices into two groups according to the triggered sense: cutaneous/tactile: touch, active surfaces, and mid-air; kinesthetic: manipulandum, grasp, and exoskeleton. Due to MAR applications’ mobile capabilities, we mainly focus our study on wearable haptic devices for each category and their AR possibilities. To conclude, we discuss the future paths that haptic feedback should follow for MAR applications and their challenges.},

Most of these studies have utilized AR paddles or AR cubes for interactions. However, these interactions overly constrain the users in their ability to directly manipulate AR objects and are limited in providing natural feeling in the user interface. This paper presents a novel approach to natural and intuitive interactions through a direct hand touchable interface in various AR-based user experiences. It combines markerless augmented reality with a depth camera to effectively detect multiple hand touches in an AR space. Furthermore, to simplify hand touch recognition, the point cloud generated by Kinect is analyzed and filtered out. The proposed approach can easily trigger AR interactions, and allows users to experience more intuitive and natural sensations and provides much control efficiency in diverse AR environments. Furthermore, it can easily solve the occlusion problem of the hand and arm region inherent in conventional AR approaches through the analysis of the extracted point cloud. We present the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed approach by demonstrating several implementation results such as interactive AR car design and touchable AR pamphlet. We also present an analysis of a usability study to compare the proposed approach with other well-known AR interactions.},

Es findet ein Vergleich zwischen der Touchscreen Applikation „Fatmap“1 (FATMAP {\textbar} Discover a world of adventure..., o. J.) und einem auf der Basis mobiler Augmented Reality entwickelten Prototypen statt. Um die Usability zu untersuchen, wurden Evaluationen zur Messung der Faktoren Effektivität, Effizienz und Zufriedenheit durchgeführt. Auf Grundlage der Ergebnisse wurde zudem ein Vorbereitungstool für eine alpine Skitour entwickelt. Für den Versuchsaufbau wurde zu Beginn die prototypische mobile AR-Applikation dem UX-Design Prozess folgend aufgesetzt. In dieser Phase fand eine tiefgreifende Recherche zu den Themen Orientierung, Interaktion und Skitouren statt, woraus die Anforderungen und das Konzept für den Prototyp abgeleitet wurden. Dieser wurde mit Hilfe einer Online-Plattform umgesetzt und auf einem iPad evaluiert. Das Testdesign beinhaltet Fragebögen zur wahrgenommenen User Experience, einen Usability Test zur Messung der Effizienz und einen Usability Test zur Messung der Effektivität. Insgesamt wurden 17 Proband: innen mit beiden Applikationen evaluiert, die gemessenen Faktoren ausgewertet und interpretiert. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass es Unterschiede bei der Effizienz und der Zufriedenheit der Anwendungen gibt, aber auch die Effektivität wird kontrovers diskutiert. Die Erkenntnisse bestätigen Vorteile bei der Interaktion mit dem AR-Prototypen, lassen jedoch offen, ob sich Nachteile der Effektivität durch technische Verbesserungen eliminieren lassen. In jedem Fall wurde die AR-Anwendung als spannender und origineller wahrgenommen, was zu einer höheren Motivation führt.},

	abstract = {This article outlines relevant economic patterns in a world with artificial intelligence (AI). Five specific economic patterns influenced by AI are discussed: (1) following in the footsteps of ‘homo economicus’ a new type of agent, ‘machina economica’, enters the stage of the global economy. (2) The pattern of division of labor and specialization is further accelerated by AI-induced micro-division of labor. (3) The introduction of AI leads to triangular agency relationships and next level information asymmetries. (4) Data and AI-based machine labor have to be understood as new factors of production. (5) The economics of AI networks can lead to market dominance and unwanted external effects. The analytical perspective is rooted in institutional economics and serves to integrate findings from relevant disciplines in economics and computer science. It is based on the research proposition that ‘institutional matters’ are of high relevance also in a world with AI but that AI gives a new meaning to these matters. The discussion unveils a reinforcing interdependence of the patterns portrayed and points to required research.},

Nach 10 Jahren Entwicklungszeit ist Skull and Bones endlich veröffentlicht. Doch so richtig fertig fühlt sich Ubisofts Piraten-Open-World-Segelschiff-Spiel trotzdem noch nicht an. Stattdessen lässt Skull and Bones viele durchaus interessante Ansätze versanden und kann selbst seine besten Momente nicht richtig nutzen.

Im Test-Video gehen wir trotzdem auch auf die Stärken von Skull and Bones ein, denn auch die gibt es. Am Ende wird jedoch die negative Kritik überwiegen, denn wenn Skull and Bones tatsächlich das ist, was Ubisoft unter einem "AAAA-Spiel" versteht... dann gute Nacht.

	abstract = {Selling virtual goods for real money is an increasingly popular revenue model for massively-multiplayer online games (MMOs), social networking sites (SNSs) and other online hangouts. In this paper, we argue that the marketing of virtual goods currently falls short of what it could be. Game developers have long created compelling game designs, but having to market virtual goods to players is a relatively new situation to them. Professional marketers, on the other hand, tend to overlook the internal design of games and hangouts and focus on marketing the services as a whole. To begin bridging the gap, we propose that the design patterns and game mechanics commonly used in games and online hangouts should be viewed as a set of marketing techniques designed to sell virtual goods. Based on a review of a number of MMOs, we describe some of the most common patterns and game mechanics and show how their effects can be explained in terms of analogous techniques from marketing science. The results provide a new perspective to game design with interesting implications to developers. Moreover, they also suggest a radically new perspective to marketers of ordinary goods and services: viewing marketing as a form of game design.},

	abstract = {Das Unternehmen Netflix stellt heutzutage eine bekannte Größe im Bereich der Produktion, Bündelung und Distribution von Medieninhalten dar. Der 1997 gegründete Videostreaming-Dienst hat sich als wandlungsfähiges Unternehmen erwiesen, welches sich unter Anwendung neuer Technologien stetig weiterentwickelt. Dabei sieht sich das Unternehmen mittlerweile einem starken Wettbewerb anderer Anbieter, wie beispielsweise Disney+ oder Amazon Prime Video, ausgesetzt. Die Zielsetzung liegt deswegen darin, Kunden für einen möglichst langen Zeitraum an die eigene Plattform zu binden und deren dauerhafte Zufriedenheit sicherzustellen. In diesem Zusammenhang werden in diesem Kapitel drei ökonomische Herausforderungen für Netflix, sowie Lösungsansätze für diese ökonomischen Bezugsprobleme mittels automatisch generierter und personalisierter Thumbnails, thematisiert.},

In der Initiierungs- und Vorproduktionsphase des Wertschöpfungsprozesses von Filmmedienunternehmen wie Disney werden die Tätigkeiten, die der Algorithmus mittelfristig substituieren könnte, von verschiedenen fest oder frei beschäftigten Akteuren übernommen oder begleitet. So werden etwa vor Produktionsbeginn des Filmmedienguts die Filmdrehbücher durch das künstlerische Handwerk von Storyboard Artists und Animatic Experts in Szenenbilder, ein Storyboard und darauf aufbauende Bewegtbilder, die Animatics umgesetzt, bevor die weitere Kreation des Filmmediums durch die Produzenten, Regisseure und übrigen Akteure voranschreitet. Das bringt einen erheblichen Kosten- und Zeitaufwand mit sich, der vor der eigentlichen Produktion entsteht. In diesem Aufsatz beleuchten wir den von Zhang et al. (2019, http://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.05440v1) präsentierten Algorithmus als potenzielles Mittel zur Behebung mancher typischer ökonomischer Bezugsprobleme, die ihre Ursprünge in den ökonomischen Eigenschaften von Filmmediengütern haben. Es werden daran anschließend die einzelnen Rationalisierungspotenziale durch den Algorithmus sowie Möglichkeiten zur Steigerung der allokativen und produktiven Effizienz in der Filmmedienbranche hervorgehoben. Abschließend geben wir einen Überblick über die gesellschaftlichen und medienökonomischen Auswirkungen, die im Kontext des Algorithmus mittel- und langfristig entstehen können.},

Dieser Beitrag befasst sich mit der sogenannten Procedural Content Generation (PCG) bei Games, welche genau hier ansetzt. Es werden ein konkreter Blick auf die Wertschöpfungsstufe der Produktion gerichtet und medienwirtschaftliche Besonderheiten in der Games Branche analysiert. Auf die Funktionsweise und Möglichkeiten eines bestimmten Algorithmus wird im Detail eingegangen. So soll ein Ausblick gegeben werden, wie Unternehmen in der Games Branche die Produktion ihres Contents verbessern und effizienter gestalten können und was in Zukunft bei der Produktion von Videospielen möglich sein wird.},

	abstract = {Die Medienwirtschaft und das Medienmanagement sind heutzutage in einem solchen Umfang von technischen Veränderungen betroffen, dass es erforderlich wird, die Automatisierung derjenigen Tätigkeiten genauer in den Blick zu nehmen, die früher als nicht durchgreifend technisch rationalisierbar erschienen (vgl. Rimscha und Siegert 2015, S. 160 f.). Diese Tätigkeiten wurden als zu komplex, zu kreativ, zu intellektuell, zu intuitiv oder nur kognitiv flexibel bewältigbar eingeschätzt, um sie technisch zu substituieren, entlang der nachfolgend zitierten Vorstellung: „Kreative Arbeit kann nur begrenzt systematisiert und in festgelegte Prozesse gegossen werden.“ (Rimscha und Siegert 2015, S. 161). Der Kultursektor und der Mediensektor galten deshalb als Sektoren, die sich bei entsprechenden Wertschöpfungstätigkeiten durch eine gewisse Resistenz gegen die völlige ökonomische Durchrationalisierung auszeichneten (vgl. Kiefer und Steininger 2014, S. 173 ff.), vor allem bei Content-Konzeptions- (z. B. Ideenentwicklung für Bücher), Content-Produktions- (z. B. Musikkomposition) und Content-Bündelungsprozessen (z. B. Programmgestaltung im Rundfunk). Mit dieser Ökonomisierungsresistenz waren aber auch immer die Fragen verbunden,In den letzten Jahren finden sich in der akademischen Literatur vermehrt Aufzählungen, bei welchen Content-Wertschöpfungsvorgängen sich die Unterstellung einer Nichtrationalisierbarkeit kreativ-intellektueller Produktion von Medieninhalten heute nicht mehr halten lässt (vgl. Zydorek 2018, zuletzt Saurwein 2022), Nachrichtenmedien berichten z. B. gerne über den neu aufgetauchten alten Meister, der Algorithmen-gestützt gemalt wurde (Guardian 2016), den computergenerierten virtuellen Influencer (T3N 2019), das KI-generierte nie endende Death-Metal-Konzert (Der Standard 2019) und die Ununterscheidbarkeit algorithmisch generierter von menschlich verfassten Nachrichten (New York Times 2015).},

Die beiden Unternehmen setzten sich zum Ziel, einen mit Künstlicher Intelligenz koproduzierten Manga zu realisieren. Dabei soll der klassische Produktionsprozess der Schwarz-Weiß Bücher in Teilen seiner Wertschöpfungskette durch eine KI erweitert werden, die menschliche Arbeit substituiert. Auf diese Weise könnten sich einerseits medienökonomische Rationalisierungspotenziale bei der Contentkonzeption und -produktion in der Manga-Branche eröffnen, andererseits könnte dies die Produktion hochqualitativer Contents ermöglichen, die den Stil bereits verstorbener Manga-Künstler imitieren und damit höhere wirtschaftliche Erfolgsaussichten haben.},

Entsprechend gilt es eine Balance für den Einsatz von DRM-Technologien zu finden, insbesondere dann, wenn diese zu einem integralen Bestandteil digitaler Geschäftsmodelle für Content werden.

Mit der zunehmenden multimedialen und damit bandbreitenintensiven Anreicherung des Internets als Kommunikations- und Informationsraum kristallisieren sich Verteilungs- und Verfügungskonflikte über Zugang zu und Vertrieb von multimedialen Inhalten und Diensten heraus. Gerade die datenintensiven Angebote audiovisueller Medien veranlassen die Diskussion um die gesellschaftliche Bedeutung und strukturelle Abhängigkeiten zwischen der Telekommunikationsindustrie als Gatekeeper zur Infrastruktur und der immensen Vielfalt an Anbietern publizistischer Angebote im Internet.

	abstract = {Sind (Massen-)Medien per se meritorische Güter? Nein! Grundlegenden Aussagen, die zum Beispiel „die Presse“ in ihrer Gesamtheit auch unter ökonomischer Sicht als meritorisches Gut umschreiben (vgl. z. B. Haller 2004, S. 61) können im Grunde so nicht formuliert werden, zumal ja Tagespresse wie publizistisch ausgerichtete Onlinemedien beweisen, dass neben dem inhaltlichen auch der (erforderte) marktausgleichende Aspekt einer Meritorik-Definition nicht erfüllt ist. Schließlich sind für Tageszeitungen in ihrer Gesamtheit regulierende Eingriffe nicht erforderlich – noch immer nicht, mag man hinzufügen. Stattdessen muss es vielmehr heißen: Medien besitzen meritorische wie demeritorische Güteraspekte (vgl. Heinrich 2001a, S. 101), oder, vielleicht noch besser: Medienangebote treffen meritorische Bedürfnisse. Dieser Beitrag betont: Meritorik benötigt für die Medienwirtschaft konsequenterweise einen nachfragegeleiteten Begriff. Das bedeutet: Medien können meritorische Bedürfnisse wie Informiertheit oder Meinungsbildung befriedigen, sie stehen damit für eine bedeutende Säule tragfähiger, demokratischer Gesellschaftsformen. Dementsprechend schafft massenmediale Kommunikation nicht a priori Rechtfertigungszwängen unterliegende Angebote für die Gesellschaft, aber sie ist in der Lage, neben handlungsleitend eingesetzten auch meritorische Bedürfnisse zu befriedigen. Dies hat die medienökonomische Literatur – obwohl von der Finanzwissenschaft ursprünglich so angelegt – bis heute aus Sicht des Autors nicht ausreichend nachvollzogen.},

Artificial intelligence has long been an important part of game development practices. The forces of change in the industry present an opportunity for Game AI to have new and profound impact on game production practices. Specifically, Game AI agents should act as “producers” responsible for managing a long-running set of live games, their player communities, and real-world context. We characterize a confluence of four major forces at play in the games industry today, together producing a wealth of data that opens unique research opportunities and challenges for Game AI in game production. We enumerate 12 new research areas spawned by these forces and steps toward how they can be addressed by data-driven Game AI Producers.},

Es werden ein konkreter Blick auf die Wertschöpfungsstufe der Produktion gerichtet und medienwirtschaftliche Besonderheiten in der Games Branche analysiert. Auf die Funktionsweise und Möglichkeiten eines bestimmten Algorithmus wird im Detail eingegangen. So soll ein Ausblick gegeben werden, wie Unternehmen in der Games Branche die Produktion ihres Contents verbessern und effizienter gestalten können und was in Zukunft bei der Produktion von Videospielen möglich sein wird.},

Es zeigte sich, dass sich Games als wesentlicher Bestandteil der Digitalkultur durchaus anspruchsvoll mit dem gesellschaftlich relevantesten Thema dieser Zeit auseinandersetzen können. Mithin leisteten Games Beiträge in unterschiedlichen Bereichen. Der Beitrag nähert sich aus einer kommunikationswissenschaftlichen Perspektive der Frage, welche Leistungen und Funktionen Computerspiele bereitstellen. Dazu werden zunächst die Charakteristika von Computerspielen als digitale Massenkommunikationsmedien herausgearbeitet und darauf aufbauend sieben unterschiedliche Leistungen und Funktionen von Computerspielen mit Beispielen beschrieben und illustriert.},

	abstract = {A project can be divided into project phases. There are different possibilities for structuring in the literature, as well as company-specific names. For this book, the following four practice-oriented phases are defined:Strategy phase The strategy phase begins with a situation analysis and environmental analysis in order to determine the framework conditions for a project to be carried out. If a project becomes concrete, the definition of project goals takes place. Initial solutions complete the basics for a project assignment. The project assignment stands for the start of a project. Depending on the size and type of the project, the creation of a requirements and duties list is necessary.Planning phase The project planning is a essential task of the project manager. The result of the project planning is the project plan, which includes further plans. The most important plans are the work breakdown structure (WBS) and the schedule including milestone plan and the resource and cost plan based on it. The task of the project organization is to find an optimal structure in interaction with the line organization for a successful project implementation. Corresponding roles and committees have to be defined.Realization phase The controlling of a project is another essential task of the project manager. The focus is on the organization of the acceptance of interim milestones, the project completion or—if necessary—the project termination before. Other priorities are the ensuring of communication in the project and with the stakeholders as well as activities in case of disruptions in the project course. Based on the milestone plan, the project progress can be controlled and possible schedule difficulties can be identified with the milestone trend analysis.Closure phase In this phase, the project is completed, the central point is the acceptance of the project by the principal. In a post-phase, final work, handovers and the release of resources take place at the end. Lessons learned and a final documentation secure the acquired knowledge for future projects.},

	abstract = {Recent years have seen a rapid proliferation of mass-market consumer software that takes inspiration from video games. Usually summarized as "gamification", this trend connects to a sizeable body of existing concepts and research in human-computer interaction and game studies, such as serious games, pervasive games, alternate reality games, or playful design. However, it is not clear how "gamification" relates to these, whether it denotes a novel phenomenon, and how to define it. Thus, in this paper we investigate "gamification" and the historical origins of the term in relation to precursors and similar concepts. It is suggested that "gamified" applications provide insight into novel, gameful phenomena complementary to playful phenomena. Based on our research, we propose a definition of "gamification" as the use of game design elements in non-game contexts.},

This model helps in the segmentation/clustering of users based on intrinsic and extrinsic motivational factors. We identify six gamification user types: Socializers, Free Spirits, Achievers, Philanthropists, Players and Disruptors. Together with the model, we suggest gamification mechanics that offer suitable motivational affordances for each user type. The model should assist researchers and practitioners in tailored and personalized gamified system design, to make gamified systems more appealing and successful. In the future, we will empirically validate and advance the model.},

	abstract = {This study investigated the actual efficiency of ludicization, ludic metaphorization of educational contexts, by identifying whether it exerted counterproductive effects on learning achievement, intrinsic motivation, and extrinsic motivation. Seventy participants were divided into the ludicization and traditional didactic groups. According to the Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA), CET-4 posttest average score was not lower for the ludicization group (N = 35, M = 65.956, SD = 1.490) than for the traditional didactic pedagogy group (N = 35, M = 61.858, SD = 1.490). According to the t-test, the average score in intrinsic motivation was insignificantly higher for the ludicization group (N = 35, M = 13.6000, SD = 2.48762) than for the traditional didactic pedagogy group (N = 35, M = 13.4571, SD = 2.24057), while the average score in extrinsic motivation was significantly lower for the group (N = 35, M = 12.2857, SD = 2.58470) than for the traditional didactic group (N = 35, M = 13.5714, SD = 2.66001). Thus, ludicization exerted counterproductive effects on extrinsic motivation. Ludicization produced poorly internalized extrinsic motivation that restrained intrinsic motivation and learning achievement. Despite potentially counterproductive effects, ludicization and game-related pedagogies still have promising effects on pedagogical practices if applied appropriately.},

	abstract = {Gamification has often been used to stimulate learner engagement via intangible rewards, such as virtual points and virtual badges, rather than material goods or benefits. However, not all learners value such intangible rewards; some express their desire to redeem intangible rewards for utilitarian resources or benefits. Although tangible rewards have long been considered a key gamification mechanism in commercial loyalty programs, few studies have explicitly explored its effectiveness in the context of gamified education. To address this gap, the present study used a randomized controlled trial approach to examine the effects of tangible rewards that are redeemed through intangible rewards on students' intrinsic motivation, behavioural and cognitive engagement, and learning performance in a fully online gamified flipped class. Each student was randomly assigned either to the tangible rewards group (EG = 28) or the intangible rewards group (CG = 29). The students in EG significantly outperformed those in CG in terms of intrinsic motivation, behavioural engagement, cognitive engagement and learning performance in the final exam. The results provided practical implications for instructors who plan to use tangible rewards in their gamified classes. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic Fully online learning often suffers from a lack of student engagement. Gamification is often used to stimulate learner engagement via intangible rewards (eg, virtual points and badges) that do not contain any utilitarian benefits outside the gamified system. Not all learners value intangible rewards over time—instead, they desire to convert the intangible badges or points into more utilitarian benefits/resources. What this paper adds This study conducted a randomized controlled experiment to compare the effects of redeemable tangible rewards and intangible rewards on student intrinsic motivation, behavioural engagement, cognitive engagement and learning performance. The tangible rewards group significantly outperformed the intangible rewards group in all aspects. Implications for practice Using tangible rewards is better than merely using intangible rewards in gamified learning. Practitioners should link tangible rewards to a standard of performance. Practitioners should also set a specific and moderately challenging redemption goal.},

	abstract = {Context: While most research shows positive effects of gamification, the focus on its adverse effects is considerably smaller and further understanding is needed. Objective: To provide a comprehensive overview on research reporting negative effects of game design elements and to provide insights into the awareness of developers on these effects and into how they could be considered in practice. Method: We conducted a systematic mapping study of the negative effects of game design elements on education/learning systems. We also held a focus group discussion with developers of a gamified software, discussing the mapping study results with regard to their awareness and perceptions on the reported negative effects in practice. Results: The mapping study revealed 87 papers reporting undesired effects of game design elements. We found that badges, leaderboards, competitions, and points are the game design elements most often reported as causing negative effects. The most cited negative effects were lack of effect, worsened performance, motivational issues, lack of understanding, and irrelevance. The ethical issues of gaming the system and cheating were also often reported. As part of our results, we map the relations between game design elements and the negative effects that they may cause. The focus group revealed that developers were not aware of many of the possible negative effects and that they consider this type of information useful. The discussion revealed their agreement on some of those potential negative effects and also some positive counterparts. Conclusions: Gamification, when properly applied, can have positive effects on education/learning software. However, gamified software is also prone to generate harmful effects. Revealing and discussing potentially negative effects can help to make more informed decisions considering their trade-off with respect to the expected benefits.},

Humankind has gone too far into exploring entertainment options, while the education system has not really kept up. Millennials love playing games, and this addiction can be used to engage and motivate them in the learning process. This study examines the effect of digital game-based learning on student engagement and motivation levels and the gender differences in online learning settings. This study was conducted in two distinct phases. A game-based and traditional online quizzing tools were used to compare levels of engagement and motivation, as well as to assess the additional parameter of gender difference. During the first phase of the study, 276 male and female undergraduate students were recruited from Sophomore Seminar classes, and 101 participated in the survey, of which 83 were male and 18 were female. In the second phase, 126 participants were recruited, of which 107 (63 females and 44 males) participated in the anonymous feedback surveys. The results revealed that digital game-based learning has a more positive impact on student engagement and motivation compared to traditional online activities. The incorporation of a leaderboard as a gaming element in the study was found to positively impact the academic performance of certain students, but it could also demotivate some students. Furthermore, female students generally showed a slightly higher level of enjoyment toward the games compared to male students, but they did not prefer a comparison with other students as much as male students did. The favorable response from students toward digital game-based activities indicates that enhancing instruction with such activities will not only make learning an enjoyable experience for learners but also enhance their engagement.},

Previous research, although not entirely conclusive, generally supports the hypothesis underlying this aim. However, previous studies have often treated gamification as a generic construct, neglecting the fact that there are many different game design elements which can result in very diverse applications. Based on a self-determination theory framework, we present the results of a randomized controlled study that used an online simulation environment. We deliberately varied different configurations of game design elements, and analysed them in regard to their effect on the fulfilment of basic psychological needs. Our results show that badges, leaderboards, and performance graphs positively affect competence need satisfaction, as well as perceived task meaningfulness, while avatars, meaningful stories, and teammates affect experiences of social relatedness. Perceived decision freedom, however, could not be affected as intended. We interpret these findings as general support for our main hypothesis that gamification is not effective per se, but that specific game design elements have specific psychological effects. Consequences for further research, in particular the importance of treatment checks, are discussed.},

	abstract = {Requirements engineering (RE) is a discipline that focuses on obtaining a specification for a system that fulfils the expectations of the stakeholders. Unfortunately, the current state of the practice reveals that only a few stakeholders are involved—mostly key clients and lead designers—while active stakeholders are not highly engaged. This lowers the chances of obtaining a system that fully fulfils the stakeholders’ wishes. Gamification is an opportunity to increase the engagement of stakeholders in RE by establishing feedback loops that reward the useful participants, i.e., those who provide valuable contributions (requirements) for the system being designed. The related trend of crowdsourcing can be employed to maximise the number of participating stakeholders, by making RE a participatory activity where current and prospective users, developers, clients and analysts are involved. This chapter introduces the Crowd-Centric Requirements Engineering (CCRE) method that guides software producing organisations (SPOs) by involving a crowd of engaged stakeholders in RE. CCRE uses the REfine tool, a gamified platform for eliciting and refining requirements. In addition to presenting the method and its application in a case study, we define research challenges for the field.},

	abstract = {Over the past decade, systems that are used to support the early phases of the innovation process have evolved from simple suggestion boxes to sophisticated social media platforms for the development and refinement of ideas. Organisations who want to profit from the use of these platforms face the following two significant and interconnected challenges: First, organisations have to motivate (groups of) individuals to participate, and they must place them in a state of high involvement and flow. Second, organisations must inspire individuals in order to generate creative output. One activity that leads to high motivation, to a feeling of flow and involvement, and to creative output, is play. This chapter focuses on the question of how to design social media based on open innovation tools to harness the potential of play by applying game mechanics to innovation management. It is argued that there are two possibilities: either enriching open innovation tools with game mechanics (gamification) or adjusting a multiplayer online game to the purpose of ideation (online ideation game). This chapter sheds light on these two possibilities and gives practical implications for implementation. The first section of this chapter describes how specific game mechanics can be implemented in social media based on open innovation tools. The second section of this chapter illustrates a number of online ideation games that have recently been applied and shows how the previous described game mechanics can also serve as building blocks for those games. The third section of this chapter gives managers key lessons at hand who strive to apply game mechanics to innovation management. The key lessons relate to (1) the planning and design phase and (2) the introduction and operation phase of a gamified open innovation tool or an online ideation game.},

	abstract = {Despite the fact that enterprise social software solutions such as IBM Connections and Microsoft Sharepoint are able to increase the communication as well as the collaboration among employees, companies are constantly confronted with the necessity to improve their employees’ motivation to interact with the system. Since gamification has been identified as an effective tool to enhance user acceptance, software developers adopt an increasing number of gamification elements to take advantage of it. Based on an in-depth analysis of the international market leaders in enterprise social software solutions, this chapter examines the implementation of gamification elements and critically reflects on how well they fit with the current insights of flow research in motivational psychology. We argue that current gamification elements predominately aim at the augmentation of the users’ extrinsic motivation whereas intrinsic motivation has mostly been ignored. Furthermore, we identify a trend in which gamification solutions primarily focus on rewarding quantitative improvement of work activities, neglecting qualitative performance. Subsequently, current solutions do not match recent findings in research and ignore risks that can lower the employees’ motivation and work performance in the long run.},

These communities, in which distributed groups of individual customers focus on voluntarily sharing and elaborating innovation ideas, are used by firms to integrate customers into the ideation for new product development rooted in Chesbrough’s (2003) open innovation paradigm. Developers and decision makers realised especially within the last decade that games or game-like appeals could serve as appropriate gamifications to attract people to participate in VICs. Therefore, gamification gained momentum and has been widely implemented into VICs. The use of gamification does, however, not lead to the intended positive outcomes per se. Because of that, obstacles and challenges in the use of gamification have to be considered, but these have often been neglected in practice. Therefore, the goal of this chapter is to address this topic and to describe major obstacles and challenges in the use of gamification in VICs.},

Die Planung und Integration von Gamification-Elementen in bestehende Geschäftsprozesse stellt hierbei eine große Herausforderung dar. Bisher existieren nur sehr wenige konkrete Notationen und Sprachen zur Dokumentation und Kommunikation von Gamification-Ansätzen. Dieser Beitrag stellt eine BPMN-Notationserweiterung und Prozessmuster für Gamification vor, die auf einer Analyse mehrerer Gamification-Beispiele beruhen. Die Anwendung des Ansatzes in der Praxis sowie die Evaluation durch eine Expertenbefragung zeigen auf, dass das Ergebnis ein Hilfsmittel zur Planung, Kommunikation und Dokumentation von Gamification-Vorhaben darstellt.},

	abstract = {Wissensmanagement ist eine komplexe Aufgabe, welche oftmals von existierenden Wissensmanagementsystemen nur unzureichend unterstützt wird. Insbesondere in Projekten, in welchen Projektmitarbeiter meist einen heterogenen Hintergrund haben und nur für eine begrenzte Zeit zusammenarbeiten, ist das Wissensmanagement eine große Herausforderung. Projektwissen wird nur selten dokumentiert und noch seltener wiederverwendet, da die Projektmitglieder keine Zeit und wenig Motivation für dessen Dokumentation haben. Als Konsequenz daraus werden oftmals bereits bekannte Lösungen gefunden und Projektteams machen die gleichen Fehler wie ihre Vorgänger. Gamification stellt eine Lösung für dieses Problem dar, da es darauf abzielt, die aktive Teilnahme in Anwendungssystemen zu motivieren. Der vorliegende Beitrag beschreibt die Gestaltung und Umsetzung eines gamifizierten Projektwissensmanagementsystems, genannt ProjectWorld, in einem Unternehmen. Die ProjectWorld zielt darauf ab, Mitarbeiter zu motivieren, sich dauerhaft am Wissensmanagement zu beteiligen und ihr Wissen mit anderen Mitarbeitern zu teilen. Obwohl noch keine konkreten, empirisch fundierten Ergebnisse bezüglich langfristiger Effekte auf die Wissensdokumentation und –wiederverwendung vorliegen, kann man, basierend auf qualitative Aussagen der potenziellen Nutzer, positive Auswirkungen auf das Projektwissensmanagement im Unternehmen annehmen.},

Eine Ursache hierfür ist die mangelhafte Aufbereitung von Informationen aufgrund der, insbesondere bei Nachwuchsführungskräften, oft unzureichenden Kenntnisse bei der Informationsvisualisierung. Eine vielversprechende Möglichkeit, das Wissen zur zweckmäßigen Gestaltung von Managementberichten nachhaltig zu verinnerlichen, bietet erfahrungsbasiertes Lernen mithilfe von Serious Games. Dieser Beitrag stellt ein entsprechendes prototypisches Serious Game vor. Hierbei treten Teilnehmer im sogenannten „Dashboard Tournament“ gegeneinander an, bei dem sie verschiedene Minispiele bestreiten. Jedes Minispiel adressiert eine spezifische Richtlinie aus den „International Business Communication Standards“, die auf Praxiserfahrungen sowie Erkenntnissen aus der Wissenschaft beruhen. Eine erste empirische Evaluation im Rahmen einer Lehrveranstaltung zeigt, dass das Spiel positiv aufgenommen wird und die vermittelten Richtlinien grundsätzlich erkannt werden.},

Allerdings verändert sich das Verständnis des Lernens im Jugendalter von einem Lernen auf spielerische Art und Weise zu einer Auffassung des Lernens als ernsthafte Angelegenheit. Die Anwendung von Gamification kann dem entgegenwirken. In dem vorliegenden Beitrag berichten wir von dem Projekt „GamEducation“, welches innerhalb der Lehrveranstaltung „Kooperationen im E-Business“ erstmals im Wintersemester 2012/2013 durchgeführt wurde und den Einsatz von Spielelementen zur Unterstützung des Lernens beschreibt. Die Vermittlung von Vorlesungsinhalten wird durch eine Praxisaufgabe (Hintergrundgeschichte) begleitet, um den stetigen Transfer und die Anwendung des Vorlesungswissens zu ermöglichen. Die Studierenden sammeln in mehreren Challenges sowohl als Gruppe als auch einzeln Punkte. Darüber hinaus diskutieren die Studierenden Inhalte auf einem lehrveranstaltungsbegleitenden Blog und sehen die aktuelle Rangliste als Feedback auf die eigene Leistung. Seit der ersten Durchführung von GamEducation wurde regelmäßig evaluiert. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass das Lehrkonzept die Mehrheit der Studierenden dazu motiviert sich in deutlich höherem Maße zu beteiligen und die Anwendung des Vorlesungswissens dabei hilft, die Inhalte besser zu verstehen.},

	abstract = {Punkte, Abzeichen, Bestenlisten – und schon fällt der Begriff der Gamifizierung. Die fortschreitende Digitalisierung vereinfacht den Einsatz sogenannter Spielelemente in der akademischen Bildung erheblich. Dabei bietet der Trend der Humifizierung neben Punkten, Abzeichen und Ranglisten viele niedrigschwellige und technisch wenig aufwendige Möglichkeiten der Lernmotivationssteigerung. Gamifizierung – verstanden als Designstrategie – kann helfen, motivations- und partizipationsförderliche Lernumgebungen an Hochschulen zu kreieren, in denen Studierende berufliche Kompetenzen individuell oder gemeinsam aufbauen können. Dafür muss die Gamifizierung pädagogischen Prinzipien folgen. Der vorliegende Beitrag thematisiert dies und setzt sich mit der Idee der Gamifizierung, den wesentlichen Merkmalen von Spielen und deren Potenzialen für das Lernen und Lehren in der Hochschule auseinander. Zur Verdeutlichung dessen werden hochschulische Entwicklungstendenzen wie die Anregung der Studienmotivation, vertiefendes Lernen und Senkung der Abbrecherzahlen fokussiert. Abschließend werden praktische Umsetzungsbeispiele und deren Effekte für das Lernen in der Hochschule aufgezeigt.},

Game-Based Learning stellt ein grundlegendes Prinzip dar. Lerninhalte werden hierbei auf Basis eines Spiels oder einer Simulation vermittelt. Umgesetzt wird dieses Prinzip in Serious Games bzw. in Business Games, die eine abgrenzbare Teilmenge der Serious Games darstellen. Gamification ist ein dem Game-Based Learning ähnliches, aber doch abgrenzbares Grundprinzip. Bei Gamification soll Lernen nicht auf Basis eines Spiels, sondern durch Elemente eines Spiels erfolgen.

	abstract = {Zum Alltag Jugendlicher und junger Erwachsener gehört heute das Spielen von elektronischen Video- oder Computerspielen auf Computern, Smartphones, Konsolen und ähnlichen Geräten. Während des Spielens erleben die Spielenden ein Flow-Erlebnis, welches die Konzentration steigert und Glücksmomente auslöst und so die Spielenden zum Weiterspielen animiert. Dieses Phänomen kann insbesondere im Schul- und Universitätsalltag zur Wissensvermittlung genutzt werden. Dies kann beispielsweise durch die Nutzung von Serious Games geschehen. Dabei handelt es sich überwiegend um Spiele mit einem Lernhintergrund, bei denen spieltypische Elemente eingesetzt werden. Dies soll ebenfalls zu einem Flow führen und damit einen größeren Lernerfolg erzielen. Unter diesen Gesichtspunkten wurde das Serious Game „Lost in Antarctica“ entwickelt, welches Fähigkeiten im Umgang mit Informationen vermittelt. In der vorliegenden Studie wird überprüft, ob sich die Teilnahme an einem Serious Game positiv auf den Lernerfolg im Vergleich zu klassischem Frontalunterricht auswirkt. Die Studie fand im Juni 2016 an der TU Braunschweig statt und es wurden Inhalte über die Internetrecherche in zwei Gruppen vermittelt, in der einen Gruppe durch Frontalunterricht und in der anderen Gruppe mittels „Lost in Antarctica“. Über Fragebögen wurden sowohl der direkte Wissensgewinn als auch die Motivation, der Spaß und die Zufriedenheit ermittelt. Die Datenerhebung wurde jeweils vor und nach der Veranstaltung durchgeführt, um Vergleichswerte zu haben. Die Ergebnisse zeigen, dass die Teilnahme an einem Serious Game den Lernerfolg positiv beeinflusst. Zudem war die Motivation, der Spaßfaktor und die Zufriedenheit bei der game-based Learning Methode höher als bei der Frontalunterrichtsmethode.},
